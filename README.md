## User Stories
-  __As a user of the application, I want to:__
    - Enter 2 currencies and see the exchange rate between them.
        - Seeing the rate in both directions would be a bonus.
    - Enter a source currency, a destination currency and a value, and have the value converted into the destination currency.
        - See the exchange rate that was used for the calculation.
    - Be sure any calculations I make are using the latest exchange data.
    - Have an intuitive UI that makes it clear what operations I can perform.
    - Be able to make calculations quickly, without having to type out the entire currency name.
        - Being shown currency abbreviations would be a bonus, so I don't have to look them up.
    - Have the ability to pass in a spreadsheet of data to be processed, rather than have to enter each calculation manually.
